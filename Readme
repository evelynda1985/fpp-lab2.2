Programming Assignment 2-2
Create a class called Prog2. In the main method of the class, output to the console the result of doing the following two computations:
1. get a random number x in the range 1 .. 9 and compute πx.
2. get a random number y in the range 3 .. 14 and compute yπ.
Use the RandomNumbers.java class that has been provided for you. (Do not use the Random class directly.)

This project includes:

RandomNumber to generate the number numbers
Prog1 compute x and y
App - main
Test cases with Junit
